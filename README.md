## Project Objective
Our objective is to use data collected regarding the conditions under which a coupon was either accepted or rejected by a survey-respondent to create a model to help determine whether a someone should be offered a coupon based on the likelihood that they accept it.

## Project Description
Data collected from biopsy results (positive or negative) from cervical cancer screening pool from a Venezuelan inpatient clinic. Multiple machine learning algorithms were implemented to determine whether individuals are more likely to be helathy (cancer free) or unhealthy(with positive biopsy results).
